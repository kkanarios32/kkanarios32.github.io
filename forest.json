With a series of careful design choices aimed at improving sample efficiency, our MBRL algorithm achieves a reward of 67.4\\% after only 1M environment steps, significantly outperforming DreamerV3, which achieves 53.2\\%, and, for the first time, exceeds human performance of 65.0\\%. Our method starts by constructing a SOTA model-free baseline, using a novel policy architecture that combines CNNs and RNNs. We then add three improvements to the standard MBRL setup: (a) \"Dyna with warmup\", which trains the policy on real and imaginary data, (b) \"nearest neighbor tokenizer\" on image patches, which improves the scheme to create the transformer world model (TWM) inputs, and (c) \"block teacher forcing\", which allows the TWM to reason jointly about the future tokens of the next timestep.},\n primaryclass = {cs},\n eprint = {2502.01591},\n month = {February}\n}"}},{"title":"Information Theory","uri":"004B","taxon":null,"tags":["note","unfinished","lost"],"route":"/004B/","metas":{}},{"title":"Log-Sum Inequality","uri":"004F","taxon":null,"tags":[],"route":"/004F/","metas":{}},{"title":"Muon is Scalable for LLM Training","uri":"liuMuonScalableLLM2025","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/liuMuonScalableLLM2025/","metas":{"doi":"10.48550/arXiv.2502.16982","external":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16982","bibtex":"@misc{liuMuonScalableLLM2025,\n title = {Muon Is {{Scalable}} for {{LLM Training}}},\n author = {Liu, Jingyuan and Su, Jianlin and Yao, Xingcheng and Jiang, Zhejun and Lai, Guokun and Du, Yulun and Qin, Yidao and Xu, Weixin and Lu, Enzhe and Yan, Junjie and Chen, Yanru and Zheng, Huabin and Liu, Yibo and Liu, Shaowei and Yin, Bohong and He, Weiran and Zhu, Han and Wang, Yuzhi and Wang, Jianzhou and Dong, Mengnan and Zhang, Zheng and Kang, Yongsheng and Zhang, Hao and Xu, Xinran and Zhang, Yutao and Wu, Yuxin and Zhou, Xinyu and Yang, Zhilin},\n year = {2025},\n doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2502.16982},\n urldate = {2025-02-26},\n number = {arXiv:2502.16982},\n publisher = {arXiv},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/JSHH2RNX/Liu et al. - 2025 - Muon is Scalable for LLM Training.pdf},\n keywords = {Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,Computer Science - Computation and Language,Computer Science - Machine Learning},\n langid = {english},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n abstract = {Recently, the Muon optimizer (K. Jordan et al. 2024) based on matrix orthogonalization has demonstrated strong results in training small-scale language models, but the scalability to larger models has not been proven. We identify two crucial techniques for scaling up Muon: (1) adding weight decay and (2) carefully adjusting the per-parameter update scale. These techniques allow Muon to work out-ofthe-box on large-scale training without the need of hyper-parameter tuning. Scaling law experiments indicate that Muon achieves {$\\sim$} 2{\\texttimes} computational efficiency compared to AdamW with compute optimal training. Based on these improvements, we introduce Moonlight, a 3B/16B-parameter Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) model trained with 5.7T tokens using Muon. Our model improves the current Pareto frontier, achieving better performance with much fewer training FLOPs compared to prior models. We open-source our distributed Muon implementation that is memory optimal and communication efficient. We also release the pretrained, instruction-tuned, and intermediate checkpoints to support future research.},\n primaryclass = {cs},\n eprint = {2502.16982},\n month =

While a lot of progress has been made in understanding grokking, it is still not clear why generalization is delayed and why grokking often does not happen without regularization. In this work we argue that without regularization, grokking tasks push models to the edge of numerical stability, introducing floating point errors in the Softmax that we refer to as Softmax Collapse (SC). We show that SC prevents grokking and that mitigating SC leads to grokking without regularization. Investigating the root cause of SC, we find that beyond the point of overfitting, the gradients strongly align with what we call the na{\\textasciidieresis}{\\i}ve loss minimization (NLM) direction. This component of the gradient does not change the predictions of the model but decreases the loss by scaling the logits, usually through the scaling of the weights along their current direction. We show that this scaling of the logits explains the delay in generalization characteristic of grokking, and eventually leads to SC, stopping learning altogether. To validate these hypotheses, we introduce two key contributions that mitigate the issues faced in grokking tasks: (i) StableMax, a new activation function that prevents SC and enables grokking without regularization, and (ii) {$\\perp$} Grad, a training algorithm that leads to quick generalization in grokking tasks by preventing NLM altogether. These contributions provide new insights into grokking, shedding light on its delayed generalization, reliance on regularization, and the effectiveness of known grokking-inducing methods.

Recent works have made promising steps by exploiting the prior knowledge of large language models (LLMs). However, these approaches suffer from important limitations: they are either not scalable to problems requiring billions of environment samples, due to requiring LLM annotations for each observation, or they require a diverse offline dataset, which may not exist or be impossible to collect. In this work, we address these limitations through a combination of algorithmic and systems-level contributions. We propose ONI, a distributed architecture that simultaneously learns an RL policy and an intrinsic reward function using LLM feedback. Our approach annotates the agent's collected experience via an asynchronous LLM server, which is then distilled into an intrinsic reward model. We explore a range of algorithmic choices for reward modeling with varying complexity, including hashing, classification, and ranking models. By studying their relative tradeoffs, we shed light on questions regarding intrinsic reward design for sparse reward problems. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of challenging, sparse reward tasks from the NetHack Learning Environment in a simple unified process, solely using the agent's gathered experience, without requiring external datasets.

transfer their knowledge to most downstream tasks within that environment. Referred to as \"zero-shot learning,\" this ability remains elusive for general-purpose reinforcement learning algorithms. While recent works have attempted to produce zero-shot RL agents, they make assumptions about the nature of the tasks or the structure of the MDP. We present {\\textbackslash}emph\\{Proto Successor Measure\\}: the basis set for all possible solutions of Reinforcement Learning in a dynamical system. We provably show that any possible policy can be represented using an affine combination of these policy independent basis functions. Given a reward function at test time, we simply need to find the right set of linear weights to combine these basis corresponding to the optimal policy. We derive a practical algorithm to learn these basis functions using only interaction data from the environment and show that our approach can produce the optimal policy at test time for any given reward function without additional environmental interactions.

Despite its widespread usage and being extensively studied in the classical literature, its role remains poorly understood for deep learning. In this work, we highlight that the role of weight decay in modern deep learning is different from its regularization effect studied in classical learning theory. For deep networks on vision tasks trained with multipass SGD, we show how weight decay modifies the optimization dynamics enhancing the ever-present implicit regularization of SGD via the loss stabilization mechanism. In contrast, for large language models trained with nearly one-epoch training, we describe how weight decay balances the bias-variance tradeoff in stochastic optimization leading to lower training loss and improved training stability. Overall, we present a unifying perspective from ResNets on vision tasks to LLMs: weight decay is never useful as an explicit regularizer but instead changes the training dynamics in a desirable way.

However, in deep RL, learners almost always use batch updates and replay buffers, making them computationally expensive and incompatible with streaming learning. Although the prevalence of batch deep RL is often attributed to its sample efficiency, a more critical reason for the absence of streaming deep RL is its frequent instability and failure to learn, which we refer to as stream barrier.

To this end, we introduce a novel learnable algorithm that is based on decomposing the initial problem into smaller sub-problems via intermediate goals, on the one hand, and respects the limit of the cumulative safety constraints, on the other hand -- SPEIS(Safe Policy Exploration Improvement via Subgoals). It comprises the two coupled policies trained end-to-end: subgoal and safe. The subgoal policy is trained to generate the subgoal based on the transitions from the buffer of the safe (main) policy that helps the safe policy to reach distant goals. Simultaneously, the safe policy maximizes its rewards while attempting not to violate the limit of the cumulative safety constraints, thus providing a certain level of safety. We evaluate SPEIS in a wide range of challenging (simulated) environments that involve different types of robots in two different environments: autonomous vehicles from the POLAMP environment and car, point, doggo, and sweep from the safety-gym environment.

We present an experimental analysis that shows these alternative regularizers can improve continual learning performance across a range of supervised learning tasks and model architectures. The alternative regularizers prove to be less sensitive to hyperparameters while demonstrating better training in individual tasks, sustaining trainability as new tasks arrive, and achieving better generalization performance.},\n primaryclass = {cs},\n eprint = {2406.06811},\n month = {June}\n}"}},{"title":"Learning Temporal Distances: Contrastive Successor Features Can Provide a Metric Structure for Decision-Making","uri":"myersLearningTemporalDistances2024","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/myersLearningTemporalDistances2024/","metas":{"doi":"10.48550/arXiv.2406.17098","external":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17098","bibtex":"@misc{myersLearningTemporalDistances2024,\n title = {Learning {{Temporal Distances}}: {{Contrastive Successor Features Can Provide}} a {{Metric Structure}} for {{Decision-Making}}},\n author = {Myers, Vivek and Zheng, Chongyi and Dragan, Anca and Levine, Sergey and Eysenbach, Benjamin},\n year = {2024},\n doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2406.17098},\n urldate = {2024-09-06},\n number = {arXiv:2406.17098},\n publisher = {arXiv},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/X3LR92NR/Myers et al. - 2024 - Learning Temporal Distances Contrastive Successor Features Can Provide a Metric Structure for Decis.pdf},\n keywords = {Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,Computer Science - Machine Learning},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n abstract = {Temporal distances lie at the heart of many algorithms for planning, control, and reinforcement learning that involve reaching goals, allowing one to estimate the transit time between two states.

This is not merely a definitional concern, but translates to an inability to generalize and find shortest paths. In this paper, we build on prior work in contrastive learning and quasimetrics to show how successor features learned by contrastive learning (after a change of variables) form a temporal distance that does satisfy the triangle inequality, even in stochastic settings. Importantly, this temporal distance is computationally efficient to estimate, even in high-dimensional and stochastic settings.

These lecture notes celebrate the breadth of mathematical ideas that have led to tangible advancements in Monte Carlo methods and their applications. To accommodate a diverse audience, the level of mathematical rigor varies from chapter to chapter, giving only an intuitive treatment to the most technically demanding subjects. The aim is not to be comprehensive or encyclopedic, but rather to illustrate some key principles in the design and analysis of Monte Carlo methods through a carefully-crafted choice of topics that emphasizes timeless over timely ideas. Algorithms are presented in a way that is conducive to conceptual understanding and mathematical analysis -- clarity and intuition are favored over state-of-the-art implementations that are harder to comprehend or rely on ad-hoc heuristics. To help readers navigate the expansive landscape of Monte Carlo methods, each algorithm is accompanied by a summary of its pros and cons, and by a discussion of the type of problems for which they are most useful.

While a number of methods have been proposed to enable generic self-supervised RL, based on principles such as goal-conditioned RL, behavioral cloning, and unsupervised skill learning, such methods remain limited in terms of either the diversity of the discovered behaviors, the need for high-quality demonstration data, or the lack of a clear adaptation mechanism for downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised framework to pre-train generalist policies that capture diverse, optimal, long-horizon behaviors from unlabeled offline data such that they can be quickly adapted to any arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. Our key insight is to learn a structured representation that preserves the temporal structure of the underlying environment, and then to span this learned latent space with directional movements, which enables various zero-shot policy \"prompting\" schemes for downstream tasks. Through our experiments on simulated robotic locomotion and manipulation benchmarks, we show that our unsupervised policies can solve goal-conditioned and general RL tasks in a zero-shot fashion, even often outperforming prior methods designed specifically for each setting.

To our best knowledge, no prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of ZO optimization in training deep neural networks (DNNs) without a significant decrease in performance. To overcome this roadblock, we develop DeepZero, a principled ZO deep learning (DL) framework that can scale ZO optimization to DNN training from scratch through three primary innovations. First, we demonstrate the advantages of coordinatewise gradient estimation (CGE) over randomized vector-wise gradient estimation in training accuracy and computational efficiency. Second, we propose a sparsityinduced ZO training protocol that extends the model pruning methodology using only finite differences to explore and exploit the sparse DL prior in CGE. Third, we develop the methods of feature reuse and forward parallelization to advance the practical implementations of ZO training. Our extensive experiments show that DeepZero achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on ResNet-20 trained on CIFAR-10, approaching FO training performance for the first time.

However, the preference datasets used in DAP methods are usually collected ahead of training and never updated, thus the feedback is purely offline. Moreover, responses in these datasets are often sampled from a language model distinct from the one being aligned, and since the model evolves over training, the alignment phase is inevitably off-policy. In this study, we posit that online feedback is key and improves DAP methods. Our method, online AI feedback (OAIF), uses an LLM as annotator: on each training iteration, we sample two responses from the current model and prompt the LLM annotator to choose which one is preferred, thus providing online feedback. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate via human evaluation in several tasks that OAIF outperforms both offline DAP and RLHF methods. We further show that the feedback leveraged in OAIF is easily controllable, via instruction prompts to the LLM annotator.},\n primaryclass = {cs},\n eprint = {2402.04792},\n month = {February}\n}"}},{"title":"Unsupervised Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning via Functional Reward Encodings","uri":"fransUnsupervisedZeroShotReinforcement2024","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/fransUnsupervisedZeroShotReinforcement2024/","metas":{"doi":"10.48550/arXiv.2402.17135","external":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17135","bibtex":"@misc{fransUnsupervisedZeroShotReinforcement2024,\n title = {Unsupervised {{Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning}} via {{Functional Reward Encodings}}},\n author = {Frans, Kevin and Park, Seohong and Abbeel, Pieter and Levine, Sergey},\n year = {2024},\n doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2402.17135},\n urldate = {2024-12-04},\n number = {arXiv:2402.17135},\n publisher = {arXiv},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/FUDVV3U4/Frans et al. - 2024 - Unsupervised Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning via Functional Reward Encodings.pdf},\n keywords = {Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,Computer Science - Machine Learning},\n langid = {english},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n abstract = {Can we pre-train a generalist agent from a large amount of unlabeled offline trajectories such that it can be immediately adapted to any new downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner?

Zeroth-order (ZO) methods can in principle estimate gradients using only two forward passes but are theorized to be catastrophically slow for optimizing large models. In this work, we propose a memory-efficient zerothorder optimizer (MeZO), adapting the classical ZO-SGD method to operate in-place, thereby fine-tuning LMs with the same memory footprint as inference. For example, with a single A100 80GB GPU, MeZO can train a 30-billion parameter model, whereas fine-tuning with backpropagation can train only a 2.7B LM with the same budget. We conduct comprehensive experiments across model types (masked and autoregressive LMs), model scales (up to 66B), and downstream tasks (classification, multiple-choice, and generation). Our results demonstrate that (1) MeZO significantly outperforms in-context learning and linear probing; (2) MeZO achieves comparable performance to fine-tuning with backpropagation across multiple tasks, with up to 12x memory reduction and up to 2x GPU-hour reduction in our implementation; (3) MeZO is compatible with both full-parameter and parameter-efficient tuning techniques such as LoRA and prefix tuning; (4) MeZO can effectively optimize non-differentiable objectives (e.g., maximizing accuracy or F1). We support our empirical findings with theoretical insights, highlighting how adequate pre-training and task prompts enable MeZO to fine-tune huge models, despite classical ZO analyses suggesting otherwise.},\n primaryclass = {cs},\n eprint = {2305.17333},\n month = {January}\n}"}},{"title":"Model-based Safe Reinforcement Learning using Variable Horizon Rollouts","uri":"guptaModelbasedSafeReinforcement2024","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/guptaModelbasedSafeReinforcement2024/","metas":{"doi":"10.1145/3632410.3632446","bibtex":"@inproceedings{guptaModelbasedSafeReinforcement2024,\n title = {Model-Based {{Safe Reinforcement Learning}} Using {{Variable Horizon Rollouts}}},\n author = {Gupta, Shourya and Suryaman, Utkarsh and Narava, Rahul and Jha, Shashi Shekhar},\n year = {2024},\n isbn = {979-8-4007-1634-8},\n doi = {10.1145/3632410.3632446},\n urldate = {2025-03-17},\n booktitle = {Proceedings of the 7th {{Joint International Conference}} on {{Data Science}} \\& {{Management}} of {{Data}} (11th {{ACM IKDD CODS}} and 29th {{COMAD}})},\n pages = {100--108},\n publisher = {ACM},\n address = {Bangalore India},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/FBVZY26U/Gupta et al. - 2024 - Model-based Safe Reinforcement Learning using Variable Horizon Rollouts.pdf},\n langid = {english},\n abstract = {Safe reinforcement learning aims to ensure the safety of agents and their interactions with the environment. Traditional reinforcement learning algorithms often neglect safety considerations, resulting in undesirable consequences when deployed in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, safe reinforcement learning algorithms incorporate safety constraints or modify the reward distribution to prioritize the safety of the agent. Recent literature on modelbased safe reinforcement learning uses a fixed look-ahead horizon to avoid unsafe states, limiting the agent's adaptability to changing environments. In this paper, we propose a variable horizon lookahead based on the agent's current state, resulting in improved performance and adaptability in uncertain environments. Our approach leverages the Gaussian process regression model to estimate the value of the horizon dynamically based on the agent's current state. To enhance sample efficiency, we introduce a selective sampling strategy that reduces the number of rollouts by eliminating samples that may lead to unsafe states and also optimizes the use of computational resources while ensuring safety. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in multiple mujoco environments. Our results demonstrate a significant reduction in terms of safety violations during validating compared to existing approaches from the literature.},\n month = {January}\n}"}},{"title":"Step-size Optimization for Continual Learning","uri":"degrisStepsizeOptimizationContinual2024","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/degrisStepsizeOptimizationContinual2024/","metas":{"external":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17401v1","bibtex":"@misc{degrisStepsizeOptimizationContinual2024,\n title = {Step-Size {{Optimization}} for {{Continual Learning}}},\n author = {Degris, Thomas and Javed, Khurram and Sharifnassab, Arsalan and Liu, Yuxin and Sutton, Richard},\n year = {2024},\n urldate = {2024-09-06},\n howpublished = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17401v1},\n journal = {arXiv.org},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/YSGENB8H/Degris et al. - 2024 - Step-size Optimization for Continual Learning.pdf},\n langid = {english},\n abstract = {In continual learning, a learner has to keep learning from the data over its whole life time. A key issue is to decide what knowledge to keep and what knowledge to let go. In a neural network, this can be implemented by using a step-size vector to scale how much gradient samples change network weights. Common algorithms, like RMSProp and Adam, use heuristics, specifically normalization, to adapt this step-size vector. In this paper, we show that those heuristics ignore the effect of their adaptation on the overall objective function, for example by moving the step-size vector away from better step-size vectors. On the other hand, stochastic meta-gradient descent algorithms, like IDBD (Sutton, 1992), explicitly optimize the step-size vector with respect to the overall objective function. On simple problems, we show that IDBD is able to consistently improve step-size vectors, where RMSProp and Adam do not. We explain the differences between the two approaches and their respective limitations. We conclude by suggesting that combining both approaches could be a promising future direction to improve the performance of neural networks in continual learning.},\n month = {January}\n}"}},{"title":"Discovering Hierarchical Achievements in Reinforcement Learning via Contrastive Learning","uri":"moonDiscoveringHierarchicalAchievements2023","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/moonDiscoveringHierarchicalAchievements2023/","metas":{"bibtex":"@article{moonDiscoveringHierarchicalAchievements2023,\n title = {Discovering {{Hierarchical Achievements}} in {{Reinforcement Learning}} via {{Contrastive Learning}}},\n author = {Moon, Seungyong and Yeom, Junyoung and Park, Bumsoo and Song, Hyun Oh},\n year = {2023},\n urldate = {2024-12-21},\n journal = {Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems},\n volume = {36},\n pages = {63674--63686},\n file = {/home/kellenkanarios/Downloads/Papers/Continual-RL/Moon et al_2023_Discovering Hierarchical Achievements in Reinforcement Learning via Contrastive.pdf},\n langid = {english},\n month = {December}\n}"}},{"title":"Foundations of Reinforcement Learning and Interactive Decision Making","uri":"fosterFoundationsReinforcementLearning2023","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/fosterFoundationsReinforcementLearning2023/","metas":{"doi":"10.48550/arXiv.2312.16730","external":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16730","bibtex":"@misc{fosterFoundationsReinforcementLearning2023,\n title = {Foundations of {{Reinforcement Learning}} and {{Interactive Decision Making}}},\n author = {Foster, Dylan J. and Rakhlin, Alexander},\n year = {2023},\n doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2312.16730},\n urldate = {2025-01-23},\n number = {arXiv:2312.16730},\n publisher = {arXiv},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/YCJRGLTL/Foster and Rakhlin - 2023 - Foundations of Reinforcement Learning and Interactive Decision Making.pdf},\n keywords = {Computer Science - Machine Learning,Mathematics - Optimization and Control,Mathematics - Statistics Theory,Statistics - Machine Learning,Statistics - Statistics Theory},\n langid = {english},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n abstract = {These lecture notes give a statistical perspective on the foundations of reinforcement learning and interactive decision making.

An approach to tackle this problem consists in selecting actions according to specific policies for an extended period of time, also known as options. A recent line of work to derive such exploratory options builds upon the eigenfunctions of the graph Laplacian. Importantly, until now these methods have been mostly limited to tabular domains where (1) the graph Laplacian matrix was either given or could be fully estimated, (2) performing eigendecomposition on this matrix was computationally tractable, and (3) value functions could be learned exactly. Additionally, these methods required a separate option discovery phase. These assumptions are fundamentally not scalable. In this paper we address these limitations and show how recent results for directly approximating the eigenfunctions of the Laplacian can be leveraged to truly scale up options-based exploration. To do so, we introduce a fully online deep RL algorithm for discovering Laplacianbased options and evaluate our approach on a variety of pixel-based tasks.

In contrast, the idea behind deep reinforcement learning methods is that the agent designer should not encode representational properties, but rather that the data stream should determine the properties of the representation---good representations emerge under appropriate training schemes. In this paper we bring these two perspectives together, empirically investigating the properties of representations that support transfer in reinforcement learning. We introduce and measure six representational properties over more than 25 thousand agent-task settings. We consider Deep Q-learning agents with different auxiliary losses in a pixel-based navigation environment, with source and transfer tasks corresponding to different goal locations. We develop a method to better understand why some representations work better for transfer, through a systematic approach varying task similarity and measuring and correlating representation properties with transfer performance.

In reinforcement learning, this is often modeled through temporally extended courses of actions called options. Options allow agents to make predictions and to operate at different levels of abstraction within an environment. Nevertheless, approaches based on the options framework often start with the assumption that a reasonable set of options is known beforehand. When this is not the case, there are no definitive answers for which options one should consider. In this paper, we argue that the successor representation, which encodes states based on the pattern of state visitation that follows them, can be seen as a natural substrate for the discovery and use of temporal abstractions. To support our claim, we take a big picture view of recent results, showing how the successor representation can be used to discover options that facilitate either temporally-extended exploration or planning. We cast these results as instantiations of a general framework for option discovery in which the agent's representation is used to identify useful options, which are then used to further improve its representation. This results in a virtuous, never-ending, cycle in which both the representation and the options are constantly refined based on each other. Beyond option discovery itself, we also discuss how the successor representation allows us to augment a set of options into a combinatorially large counterpart without additional learning. This is achieved through the combination of previously learned options. Our empirical evaluation focuses on options discovered for temporally-extended exploration and on the use of the successor representation to combine them. Our results shed light on important design decisions involved in the definition of options and demonstrate the synergy of different methods based on the successor representation, such as eigenoptions and the option keyboard.},\n primaryclass = {cs},\n eprint = {2110.05740},\n month = {April}\n}"}},{"title":"Does Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning Exist?","uri":"touatiDoesZeroShotReinforcement2023","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/touatiDoesZeroShotReinforcement2023/","metas":{"doi":"10.48550/arXiv.2209.14935","external":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14935","bibtex":"@misc{touatiDoesZeroShotReinforcement2023,\n title = {Does {{Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning Exist}}?},\n author = {Touati, Ahmed and Rapin, J{\\'e}r{\\'e}my and Ollivier, Yann},\n year = {2023},\n doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2209.14935},\n urldate = {2024-09-18},\n number = {arXiv:2209.14935},\n publisher = {arXiv},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/GFV8I99T/Touati et al. - 2023 - Does Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning Exist.pdf;/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/9RA8LX73/2209.html},\n keywords = {Computer Science - Machine Learning},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n abstract = {A zero-shot RL agent is an agent that can solve any RL task in a given environment, instantly with no additional planning or learning, after an initial reward-free learning phase.

Current RL agents can solve families of related tasks at best, or require planning anew for each task. Strategies for approximate zero-shot RL ave been suggested using successor features (SFs) [BBQ+ 18] or forward-backward (FB) representations [TO21], but testing has been limited. After clarifying the relationships between these schemes, we introduce improved losses and new SF models, and test the viability of zero-shot RL schemes systematically on tasks from the Unsupervised RL benchmark [LYL+21]. To disentangle universal representation learning from exploration, we work in an offline setting and repeat the tests on several existing replay buffers.

SFs with Laplacian eigenfunctions do well, while SFs based on auto-encoders, inverse curiosity, transition models, low-rank transition matrix, contrastive learning, or diversity (APS), perform unconsistently. In contrast, FB representations jointly learn the elementary and successor features from a single, principled criterion.

How can we design RL algorithms that directly acquire good representations? In this paper, instead of adding representation learning parts to an existing RL algorithm, we show (contrastive) representation learning methods can be cast as RL algorithms in their own right. To do this, we build upon prior work and apply contrastive representation learning to action-labeled trajectories, in such a way that the (inner product of) learned representations exactly corresponds to a goal-conditioned value function. We use this idea to reinterpret a prior RL method as performing contrastive learning, and then use the idea to propose a much simpler method that achieves similar performance. Across a range of goal-conditioned RL tasks, we demonstrate that contrastive RL methods achieve higher success rates than prior non-contrastive methods, including in the offline RL setting.

In the offline setting, we propose an algorithm for off-policy estimation of occupancies that can handle non-exploratory data. Using this as a subroutine, we further devise an online algorithm that constructs exploratory data distributions in a level-by-level manner. As a central technical challenge, the additive error of occupancy estimation is incompatible with the multiplicative definition of data coverage. In the absence of strong assumptions like reachability, this incompatibility easily leads to exponential error blow-up, which we overcome via novel technical tools.

We provide a thorough theoretical analysis of this approach, develop applications to transfer and standard RL, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness over standard GPI on a challenging deep RL continuous control task. We also provide an analysis of GHM training methods, proving a novel convergence result regarding previously proposed methods and showing how to train these models stably in deep RL settings.},\n primaryclass = {stat},\n eprint = {2206.08736},\n month = {June}\n}"}},{"title":"A History of Meta-gradient: Gradient Methods for Meta-learning","uri":"suttonHistoryMetagradientGradient2022","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/suttonHistoryMetagradientGradient2022/","metas":{"external":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09701v1","bibtex":"@misc{suttonHistoryMetagradientGradient2022,\n title = {A {{History}} of {{Meta-gradient}}: {{Gradient Methods}} for {{Meta-learning}}},\n author = {Sutton, Richard S.},\n year = {2022},\n urldate = {2024-09-06},\n howpublished = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09701v1},\n journal = {arXiv.org},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/93SUJHK4/Sutton - 2022 - A History of Meta-gradient Gradient Methods for Meta-learning.pdf},\n langid = {english},\n abstract = {The history of meta-learning methods based on gradient descent is reviewed, focusing primarily on methods that adapt step-size (learning rate) meta-parameters.},\n month = {February},\n shorttitle = {A {{History}} of {{Meta-gradient}}}\n}"}},{"title":"Continual Auxiliary Task Learning","uri":"mcleodContinualAuxiliaryTask2022","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/mcleodContinualAuxiliaryTask2022/","metas":{"external":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11133","bibtex":"@misc{mcleodContinualAuxiliaryTask2022,\n title = {Continual {{Auxiliary Task Learning}}},\n author = {McLeod, Matthew and Lo, Chunlok and Schlegel, Matthew and Jacobsen, Andrew and Kumaraswamy, Raksha and White, Martha and White, Adam},\n year = {2022},\n urldate = {2024-10-16},\n number = {arXiv:2202.11133},\n publisher = {arXiv},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/GUALHQEZ/McLeod et al. - 2022 - Continual Auxiliary Task Learning.pdf},\n keywords = {Computer Science - Machine Learning},\n langid = {english},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n abstract = {Learning auxiliary tasks, such as multiple predictions about the world, can provide many benefits to reinforcement learning systems.

This limits their performance in environments that are inherently stochastic, partially observed, or so large and complex that they appear stochastic to a finite agent.

We define safety as the agent remaining in a desired safe set with high probability during the operation time. The drawbacks of this formulation are twofold. The problem is non-convex and computing the gradients of the constraints with respect to the policies is prohibitive. Hence, we propose an ergodic relaxation of the constraints with the following advantages. (i) The safety guarantees are maintained in the case of episodic tasks and they hold until a given time horizon for continuing tasks. (ii) The constrained optimization problem despite its non-convexity has arbitrarily small duality gap if the parametrization of the controller is rich enough. (iii) The gradients of the Lagrangian associated to the safe learning problem can be computed using standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) results and stochastic approximation tools. Leveraging these advantages, we exploit primal-dual algorithms to find policies that are safe and optimal. We test the proposed approach in a navigation task in a continuous domain.

One hypothesis to explain this is that overparameterized deep networks enjoy the benefits of implicit regularization induced by stochastic gradient descent, which favors parsimonious solutions that generalize well on test inputs. It is reasonable to surmise that deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods could also benefit from this effect. In this paper, we discuss how the implicit regularization effect of SGD seen in supervised learning could in fact be harmful in the offline deep RL setting, leading to poor generalization and degenerate feature representations. Our theoretical analysis shows that when existing models of implicit regularization are applied to temporal difference learning, the resulting derived regularizer favors degenerate solutions with excessive ``aliasing'', in stark contrast to the supervised learning case. We back up these findings empirically, showing that feature representations learned by a deep network value function trained via bootstrapping can indeed become degenerate, aliasing the representations for state-action pairs that appear on either side of the Bellman backup. To address this issue, we derive the form of this implicit regularizer and, inspired by this derivation, propose a simple and effective explicit regularizer, called DR3, that counteracts the undesirable effects of this implicit regularizer. When combined with existing offline RL methods, DR3 substantially improves performance and stability, alleviating unlearning in Atari 2600 games, D4RL domains and robotic manipulation from images.},\n primaryclass = {cs},\n eprint = {2112.04716},\n month = {December},\n shorttitle = {{{DR3}}}\n}"}},{"title":"Learning One Representation to Optimize All Rewards","uri":"touatiLearningOneRepresentation2021","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/touatiLearningOneRepresentation2021/","metas":{"doi":"10.48550/arXiv.2103.07945","external":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07945","bibtex":"@misc{touatiLearningOneRepresentation2021,\n title = {Learning {{One Representation}} to {{Optimize All Rewards}}},\n author = {Touati, Ahmed and Ollivier, Yann},\n year = {2021},\n doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2103.07945},\n urldate = {2024-09-18},\n number = {arXiv:2103.07945},\n publisher = {arXiv},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/FN8MPGES/Touati and Ollivier - 2021 - Learning One Representation to Optimize All Rewards.pdf;/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/SXVNRKWC/2103.html},\n keywords = {Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence,Computer Science - Machine Learning,Mathematics - Optimization and Control},\n archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n abstract = {We introduce the forward-backward (FB) representation of the dynamics of a reward-free Markov decision process.

During an unsupervised phase, we use reward-free interactions with the environment to learn two representations via off-the-shelf deep learning methods and temporal difference (TD) learning. In the test phase, a reward representation is estimated either from observations or an explicit reward description (e.g., a target state). The optimal policy for that reward is directly obtained from these representations, with no planning. We assume access to an exploration scheme or replay buffer for the first phase. The corresponding unsupervised loss is well-principled: if training is perfect, the policies obtained are provably optimal for any reward function. With imperfect training, the sub-optimality is proportional to the unsupervised approximation error. The FB representation learns long-range relationships between states and actions, via a predictive occupancy map, without having to synthesize states as in model-based approaches. This is a step towards learning controllable agents in arbitrary black-box stochastic environments.

Yet, the majority of current HRL methods require careful task-specific design and on-policy training, making them difficult to apply in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we study how we can develop HRL algorithms that are general, in that they do not make onerous additional assumptions beyond standard RL algorithms, and efficient, in the sense that they can be used with modest numbers of interaction samples, making them suitable for real-world problems such as robotic control. For generality, we develop a scheme where lower-level controllers are supervised with goals that are learned and proposed automatically by the higher-level controllers. To address efficiency, we propose to use off-policy experience for both higher and lower-level training. This poses a considerable challenge, since changes to the lower-level behaviors change the action space for the higher-level policy, and we introduce an off-policy correction to remedy this challenge. This allows us to take advantage of recent advances in off-policy model-free RL to learn both higher- and lower-level policies using substantially fewer environment interactions than on-policy algorithms. We term the resulting HRL agent HIRO and find that it is generally applicable and highly sample-efficient. Our experiments show that HIRO can be used to learn highly complex behaviors for simulated robots, such as pushing objects and utilizing them to reach target locations, learning from only a few million samples, equivalent to a few days of real-time interaction.

We propose TVM, a compiler that exposes graph-level and operator-level optimizations to provide performance portability to deep learning workloads across diverse hardware back-ends. TVM solves optimization challenges specific to deep learning, such as high-level operator fusion, mapping to arbitrary hardware primitives, and memory latency hiding. It also automates optimization of low-level programs to hardware characteristics by employing a novel, learning-based cost modeling method for rapid exploration of code optimizations.

Conditional models are frequently encountered in practice; however there has not been a rigorous theoretical analysis of NCE in this setting, and we will argue there are subtle but important questions when generalizing NCE to the conditional case. In particular, we analyze two variants of NCE for conditional models: one based on a classification objective, the other based on a ranking objective. We show that the rankingbased variant of NCE gives consistent parameter estimates under weaker assumptions than the classification-based method; we analyze the statistical efficiency of the ranking-based and classification-based variants of NCE; finally we describe experiments on synthetic data and language modeling showing the effectiveness and trade-offs of both methods.},\n primaryclass = {cs},\n eprint = {1809.01812},\n month = {September},\n shorttitle = {Noise {{Contrastive Estimation}} and {{Negative Sampling}} for {{Conditional Models}}}\n}"}},{"title":"Reinforcement learning: An introduction","uri":"suttonReinforcementLearningIntroduction2018","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/suttonReinforcementLearningIntroduction2018/","metas":{"bibtex":"@book{suttonReinforcementLearningIntroduction2018,\n title = {Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction},\n author = {Sutton, Richard S. and Barto, Andrew G.},\n year = {2018},\n isbn = {978-0-262-03924-6},\n edition = {Second edition},\n series = {Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning Series},\n publisher = {The MIT Press},\n address = {Cambridge, Massachusetts},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/DY4UI6G7/Sutton and Barto - 2018 - Reinforcement learning an introduction.pdf},\n keywords = {Reinforcement learning},\n lccn = {Q325.6 .R45 2018},\n langid = {english},\n abstract = {\"Reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives while interacting with a complex, uncertain environment.

Our framework employs a Manager module and a Worker module. The Manager operates at a slower time scale and sets abstract goals which are conveyed to and enacted by the Worker. The Worker generates primitive actions at every tick of the environment. The decoupled structure of FuN conveys several benefits -- in addition to facilitating very long timescale credit assignment it also encourages the emergence of sub-policies associated with different goals set by the Manager.

An oft-noted drawback of these algorithms is that they include a step-size parameter that needs to be tuned for best performance, which may require manual intervention and significant domain knowledge or additional data. In many cases, an entire vector of step-size parameters (e.g., one for each input feature) needs to be tuned in order to attain the best performance of the algorithm. To address this, several methods have been proposed for adapting step sizes online. For example, Sutton's IDBD method can find the best vector step size for the LMS algorithm, and Schraudolph's ELK1 method, an extension of IDBD to neural networks, has proven effective on large applications, such as 3D hand tracking. However, to date all such step-size adaptation methods have included a tunable step-size parameter of their own, which we call the meta-step-size parameter. In this paper we show that the performance of existing step-size adaptation methods are strongly dependent on the choice of their meta-step-size parameter and that their meta-step-size parameter cannot be set reliably in a problem-independent way. We introduce a series of modifications and normalizations to the IDBD method that together eliminate the need to tune the meta-step-size parameter to the particular problem. We show that the resulting overall algorithm, called Autostep, performs as well or better than the existing step-size adaptation methods on a number of idealized and robot prediction problems and does not require any tuning of its meta-step-size parameter. The ideas behind Autostep are not restricted to the IDBD method and the same principles are potentially applicable to other incremental learning settings, such as reinforcement learning.},\n month = {March}\n}"}},{"title":"Introduction to Smooth Manifolds","uri":"leeIntroductionSmoothManifolds2012","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/leeIntroductionSmoothManifolds2012/","metas":{"doi":"10.1007/978-1-4419-9982-5","bibtex":"@book{leeIntroductionSmoothManifolds2012,\n title = {Introduction to {{Smooth Manifolds}}},\n author = {Lee, John M.},\n year = {2012},\n isbn = {978-1-4419-9981-8 978-1-4419-9982-5},\n doi = {10.1007/978-1-4419-9982-5},\n urldate = {2024-10-18},\n series = {Graduate {{Texts}} in {{Mathematics}}},\n volume = {218},\n publisher = {Springer New York},\n address = {New York, NY},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/GFNZMLM6/Lee - 2012 - Introduction to Smooth Manifolds.pdf},\n langid = {english},\n copyright = {https://www.springernature.com/gp/researchers/text-and-data-mining}\n}"}},{"title":"Neural Networks: Tricks of the Trade: Second Edition","uri":"montavonNeuralNetworksTricks2012","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/montavonNeuralNetworksTricks2012/","metas":{"doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-35289-8","bibtex":"@book{montavonNeuralNetworksTricks2012,\n title = {Neural {{Networks}}: {{Tricks}} of the {{Trade}}: {{Second Edition}}},\n year = {2012},\n isbn = {978-3-642-35288-1 978-3-642-35289-8},\n doi = {10.1007/978-3-642-35289-8},\n urldate = {2025-02-28},\n series = {Lecture {{Notes}} in {{Computer Science}}},\n editor = {Montavon, Gr{\\'e}goire and Orr, Genevi{\\`e}ve B. and M{\\\"u}ller, Klaus-Robert},\n volume = {7700},\n publisher = {Springer Berlin Heidelberg},\n address = {Berlin, Heidelberg},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/3R38Z36Y/Montavon et al. - 2012 - Neural Networks Tricks of the Trade Second Edition.pdf},\n langid = {english},\n copyright = {http://www.springer.com/tdm},\n shorttitle = {Neural {{Networks}}}\n}"}},{"title":"Heuristic Search for Generalized Stochastic Shortest Path MDPs","uri":"kolobovHeuristicSearchGeneralized2011","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/kolobovHeuristicSearchGeneralized2011/","metas":{"doi":"10.1609/icaps.v21i1.13452","bibtex":"@article{kolobovHeuristicSearchGeneralized2011,\n title = {Heuristic {{Search}} for {{Generalized Stochastic Shortest Path MDPs}}},\n author = {Kolobov, Andrey and Mausam, Mausam and Weld, Daniel and Geffner, Hector},\n year = {2011},\n doi = {10.1609/icaps.v21i1.13452},\n urldate = {2025-03-22},\n journal = {Proceedings of the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling},\n volume = {21},\n pages = {130--137},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/Q77EPBX6/Kolobov et al. - 2011 - Heuristic Search for Generalized Stochastic Shortest Path MDPs.pdf},\n langid = {english},\n copyright = {Copyright (c) 2021 Proceedings of the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling},\n abstract = {Research in efficient methods for solving infinite-horizon MDPs has so far concentrated primarily on discounted MDPs and the more general stochastic shortest path problems (SSPs).

In particular, the method is shown to directly work for unnormalized models, i.e. models where the density function does not integrate to one. The normalization constant can be estimated just like any other parameter. For a tractable ICA model, we compare the method with other estimation methods that can be used to learn unnormalized models, including score matching, contrastive divergence, and maximum-likelihood where the normalization constant is estimated with importance sampling.

In this paper, we take a different approach and instead address the effect of nonstationarity by adapting the widely used Adam optimiser [7]. We first analyse the impact of nonstationary gradient magnitude---such as that caused by a change in target network---on Adam's update size, demonstrating that such a change can lead to large updates and hence sub-optimal performance. To address this, we introduce Adam with Relative Timesteps, or Adam-Rel. Rather than using the global timestep in the Adam update, Adam-Rel uses the local timestep within an epoch, essentially resetting Adam's timestep to 0 after target changes. We demonstrate that this avoids large updates and reduces to learning rate annealing in the absence of such increases in gradient magnitude. Evaluating Adam-Rel in both on-policy and off-policy RL, we demonstrate improved performance in both Atari and Craftax. We then show that increases in gradient norm occur in RL in practice, and examine the differences between our theoretical model and the observed data.}\n}"}},{"title":"Adapting Bias by Gradient Descent: An Incremental Version of Delta-Bar-Delta","uri":"suttonAdaptingBiasGradient","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/suttonAdaptingBiasGradient/","metas":{"bibtex":"@article{suttonAdaptingBiasGradient,\n title = {Adapting {{Bias}} by {{Gradient Descent}}: {{An Incremental Version}} of {{Delta-Bar-Delta}}},\n author = {Sutton, Richard S},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/NJPU4WDD/Sutton - Adapting Bias by Gradient Descent An Incremental Version of Delta-Bar-Delta.pdf},\n langid = {english},\n abstract = {Appropriate bias is widely viewed as the key to efficient learning and generalization.

The IDBD algorithm adjusts the learning-rate parameters, which are an important form of bias for this system. Because bias in this approach is adapted based on previous learning experience, the appropriate testbeds are drifting or non-stationary learning tasks.

Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CCPO outperforms the baselines in terms of safety and task performance, while preserving zero-shot adaptation capabilities to different constraint thresholds data-efficiently.

This approach is also ideal for resource-constrained, communication-limited, and privacy-sensitive applications. However, in deep RL, learners almost always use batch updates and replay buffers, making them computationally expensive and incompatible with streaming learning. Although the prevalence of batch deep RL is often attributed to its sample efficiency, a more critical reason for the absence of streaming deep RL is its frequent instability and failure to learn, which we refer to as stream barrier. This paper introduces the stream-x algorithms, the first class of deep RL algorithms to overcome stream barrier for both prediction and control and match sample efficiency of batch RL. Through experiments in Mujoco Gym, DM Control, and Atari Games, we demonstrate stream barrier in existing algorithms and successful stable learning with our stream-x algorithms: stream Q, stream AC, and stream TD, achieving the best model-free performance in DM Control Dog environments. A set of common techniques underlies the stream-x algorithms, enabling their success with a single set of hyperparameters and allowing for easy extension to other algorithms, thereby reviving streaming RL.}\n}"}},{"title":"Deep Reinforcement Learning at the Edge of the Statistical Precipice","uri":"agarwalDeepReinforcementLearning","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/agarwalDeepReinforcementLearning/","metas":{"bibtex":"@article{agarwalDeepReinforcementLearning,\n title = {Deep {{Reinforcement Learning}} at the {{Edge}} of the {{Statistical Precipice}}},\n author = {Agarwal, Rishabh and Schwarzer, Max and Castro, Pablo Samuel and Courville, Aaron and Bellemare, Marc G},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/5AQZ3YSU/Agarwal et al. - Deep Reinforcement Learning at the Edge of the Statistical Precipice.pdf},\n langid = {english},\n abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are predominantly evaluated by comparing their relative performance on a large suite of tasks. Most published results on deep RL benchmarks compare point estimates of aggregate performance such as mean and median scores across tasks, ignoring the statistical uncertainty implied by the use of a finite number of training runs. Beginning with the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), the shift towards computationally-demanding benchmarks has led to the practice of evaluating only a small number of runs per task, exacerbating the statistical uncertainty in point estimates. In this paper, we argue that reliable evaluation in the few-run deep RL regime cannot ignore the uncertainty in results without running the risk of slowing down progress in the field. We illustrate this point using a case study on the Atari 100k benchmark, where we find substantial discrepancies between conclusions drawn from point estimates alone versus a more thorough statistical analysis. With the aim of increasing the field's confidence in reported results with a handful of runs, we advocate for reporting interval estimates of aggregate performance and propose performance profiles to account for the variability in results, as well as present more robust and efficient aggregate metrics, such as interquartile mean scores, to achieve small uncertainty in results. Using such statistical tools, we scrutinize performance evaluations of existing algorithms on other widely used RL benchmarks including the ALE, Procgen, and the DeepMind Control Suite, again revealing discrepancies in prior comparisons. Our findings call for a change in how we evaluate performance in deep RL, for which we present a more rigorous evaluation methodology, accompanied with an open-source library rliable2, to prevent unreliable results from stagnating the field.}\n}"}},{"title":"Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithms","uri":"silverDeterministicPolicyGradient","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/silverDeterministicPolicyGradient/","metas":{"bibtex":"@article{silverDeterministicPolicyGradient,\n title = {Deterministic {{Policy Gradient Algorithms}}},\n author = {Silver, David and Lever, Guy and Heess, Nicolas and Degris, Thomas and Wierstra, Daan and Riedmiller, Martin},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/HYF79JZL/Silver et al. - Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithms.pdf},\n langid = {english},\n abstract = {In this paper we consider deterministic policy gradient algorithms for reinforcement learning with continuous actions.

However, on problems such as the ProcGen Maze, an adequate solution that is invariant to the task visualization does not exist, and therefore invariance-based approaches fail. Our insight is that learning a policy that effectively explores the domain is harder to memorize than a policy that maximizes reward for a specific task, and therefore we expect such learned behavior to generalize well; we indeed demonstrate this empirically on several domains that are difficult for invariancebased approaches. Our Explore to Generalize algorithm (ExpGen) builds on this insight: we train an additional ensemble of agents that optimize reward. At test time, either the ensemble agrees on an action, and we generalize well, or we take exploratory actions, which generalize well and drive us to a novel part of the state space, where the ensemble may potentially agree again. We show that our approach is the state-of-the-art on tasks of the ProcGen challenge that have thus far eluded effective generalization, yielding a success rate of 83\\% on the Maze task and 74\\% on Heist with 200 training levels.

Such intrinsic behaviors could eventually help the agent solve tasks posed by the environment. We present hierarchicalDQN (h-DQN), a framework to integrate hierarchical action-value functions, operating at different temporal scales, with goal-driven intrinsically motivated deep reinforcement learning. A top-level q-value function learns a policy over intrinsic goals, while a lower-level function learns a policy over atomic actions to satisfy the given goals. h-DQN allows for flexible goal specifications, such as functions over entities and relations. This provides an efficient space for exploration in complicated environments. We demonstrate the strength of our approach on two problems with very sparse and delayed feedback: (1) a complex discrete stochastic decision process with stochastic transitions, and (2) the classic ATARI game --`Montezuma's Revenge'.}\n}"}},{"title":"High-Dimensional Probability","uri":"vershyninHighDimensionalProbability","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/vershyninHighDimensionalProbability/","metas":{"bibtex":"@article{vershyninHighDimensionalProbability,\n title = {High-{{Dimensional Probability}}},\n author = {Vershynin, Roman},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/DC3KWF38/Vershynin - High-Dimensional Probability.pdf},\n langid = {english}\n}"}},{"title":"Jon Sterling","uri":"jonmsterling","taxon":"Person","tags":["new-spaces","typesynth","stc","gdt","cubical"],"route":"/jonmsterling/","metas":{"external":"https://www.jonmsterling.com/index/","institution":"https://kkanarios32.github.io/camcl/; https://kkanarios32.github.io/00GP/","orcid":"0000-0002-0585-5564","position":"Associate Professor","phd-advisor":"robertharper","postdoc-advisor":"larsbirkedal"}},{"title":"Kellen Kanarios","uri":"kellenkanarios","taxon":"Person","tags":[],"route":"/kellenkanarios/","metas":{"external":"https://kellenkanarios.github.io/","institution":"https://kkanarios32.github.io/University%20of%20Michigan/","position":"PhD Student"}},{"title":"Kellen Kanarios","uri":"0001","taxon":null,"tags":["home"],"route":"/0001/","metas":{"author":"false"}},{"title":"Lecture Notes on Game Theory","uri":"borgersLectureNotesGame","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/borgersLectureNotesGame/","metas":{"bibtex":"@article{borgersLectureNotesGame,\n title = {Lecture {{Notes}} on {{Game Theory}}},\n author = {Borgers, Tilman},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/CYJDCVHC/Borgers - Lecture Notes on Game Theory.pdf},\n langid = {english}\n}"}},{"title":"Lei Ying","uri":"leiying","taxon":"Person","tags":[],"route":"/leiying/","metas":{"external":"https://leiying.engin.umich.edu/","institution":"University of Michigan","position":"Professor"}},{"title":"Math 395 Notes","uri":"analysis","taxon":"Reference","tags":["texnote"],"route":"/analysis/","metas":{"external":"notes/395-note.pdf"}},{"title":"Math 494 Notes","uri":"algebra","taxon":"Reference","tags":["texnote"],"route":"/algebra/","metas":{"external":"notes/494-note.pdf"}},{"title":"Math 597 Notes","uri":"measure","taxon":"Reference","tags":["texnote"],"route":"/measure/","metas":{"external":"notes/597-note.pdf"}},{"title":"Math 602 Notes","uri":"functional","taxon":"Reference","tags":["texnote"],"route":"/functional/","metas":{"external":"notes/602-note.pdf"}},{"title":"Nan Jiang","uri":"nanjiang","taxon":"Person","tags":[],"route":"/nanjiang/","metas":{"external":"https://nanjiang.cs.illinois.edu/","institution":"University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign","position":"Professor"}},{"title":"Near Optimal Representation Learning for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning","uri":"nachum2019","taxon":"Reference","tags":["contrastive","potw"],"route":"/nachum2019/","metas":{"bibtex":"@misc{nachum2019nearoptimalrepresentationlearninghierarchical,\n      title={Near-Optimal Representation Learning for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning}, \n      author={Ofir Nachum and Shixiang Gu and Honglak Lee and Sergey Levine},\n      year={2019},\n      eprint={1810.01257},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.AI},\n      url={https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01257}, \n}"}},{"title":"Noise-Contrastive Estimation of Unnormalized Statistical Models, with Applications to Natural Image Statistics","uri":"gutmannNoiseContrastiveEstimationUnnormalized","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/gutmannNoiseContrastiveEstimationUnnormalized/","metas":{"bibtex":"@article{gutmannNoiseContrastiveEstimationUnnormalized,\n title = {Noise-{{Contrastive Estimation}} of {{Unnormalized Statistical Models}}, with {{Applications}} to {{Natural Image Statistics}}},\n author = {Gutmann, Michael U and Gutmann, Michael and Hyvarinen, Aapo and Hyvarinen, Aapo},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/7HQNNPRL/Gutmann et al. - Noise-Contrastive Estimation of Unnormalized Statistical Models, with Applications to Natural Image.pdf},\n langid = {english},\n abstract = {We consider the task of estimating, from observed data, a probabilistic model that is parameterized by a finite number of parameters. In particular, we are considering the situation where the model probability density function is unnormalized. That is, the model is only specified up to the partition function. The partition function normalizes a model so that it integrates to one for any choice of the parameters. However, it is often impossible to obtain it in closed form. Gibbs distributions, Markov and multi-layer networks are examples of models where analytical normalization is often impossible. Maximum likelihood estimation can then not be used without resorting to numerical approximations which are often computationally expensive. We propose here a new objective function for the estimation of both normalized and unnormalized models. The basic idea is to perform nonlinear logistic regression to discriminate between the observed data and some artificially generated noise. With this approach, the normalizing partition function can be estimated like any other parameter. We prove that the new estimation method leads to a consistent (convergent) estimator of the parameters. For large noise sample sizes, the new estimator is furthermore shown to behave like the maximum likelihood estimator. In the estimation of unnormalized models, there is a trade-off between statistical and computational performance. We show that the new method strikes a competitive trade-off in comparison to other estimation methods for unnormalized models. As an application to real data, we estimate novel two-layer models of natural image statistics with spline nonlinearities.}\n}"}},{"title":"Noise-contrastive Estimation","uri":"gutmann2012","taxon":"Reference","tags":["contrastive"],"route":"/gutmann2012/","metas":{"abstract":"We present a new estimation principle for parameterized statistical models. The idea is to perform nonlinear logistic regression to discriminate between the observed data and some artificially generated noise, using the model log-density function in the regression nonlinearity.  We show that this leads to a consistent (convergent) estimator of the parameters, and analyze the asymptotic variance.  In particular, the method is shown to directly work for unnormalized models, i.e. models where the density function does not integrate to one. The normalization constant can be estimated just like any other parameter. For a tractable ICA model, we compare the method with other estimation methods that can be used to learn unnormalized models, including score matching, contrastive divergence, and maximum-likelihood where the normalization constant is estimated with importance sampling. Simulations show that noise-contrastive estimation offers the best trade-off between computational and statistical efficiency. The method is then applied to the modeling of natural images: We show that the method can successfully estimate a large-scale two-layer model and a Markov random field.","bibtex":"@InProceedings{pmlr-v9-gutmann10a,\n  title = \t {Noise-contrastive estimation: A new estimation principle for unnormalized statistical models},\n  author = \t {Gutmann, Michael and Hyvärinen, Aapo},\n  booktitle = \t {Proceedings of the Thirteenth International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics},\n  pages = \t {297--304},\n  year = \t {2010},\n  editor = \t {Teh, Yee Whye and Titterington, Mike},\n  volume = \t {9},\n  series = \t {Proceedings of Machine Learning Research},\n  address = \t {Chia Laguna Resort, Sardinia, Italy},\n  month = \t {13--15 May},\n  publisher =    {PMLR},\n  pdf = \t {http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/gutmann10a/gutmann10a.pdf},\n  url = \t {https://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/gutmann10a.html},\n}"}},{"title":"Occupancy-based Policy Gradient: Estimation, Convergence, and Optimality","uri":"huangOccupancybasedPolicyGradient","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/huangOccupancybasedPolicyGradient/","metas":{"bibtex":"@article{huangOccupancybasedPolicyGradient,\n title = {Occupancy-Based {{Policy Gradient}}: {{Estimation}}, {{Convergence}}, and {{Optimality}}},\n author = {Huang, Audrey and Jiang, Nan},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/P7NI2N95/Huang and Jiang - Occupancy-based Policy Gradient Estimation, Convergence, and Optimality.pdf},\n langid = {english},\n abstract = {Occupancy functions play an instrumental role in reinforcement learning (RL) for guiding exploration, handling distribution shift, and optimizing general objectives beyond the expected return. Yet, computationally efficient policy optimization methods that use (only) occupancy functions are virtually non-existent. In this paper, we establish the theoretical foundations of model-free policy gradient (PG) methods that compute the gradient through the occupancy for both online and offline RL, without modeling value functions. Our algorithms reduce gradient estimation to squared-loss regression and are computationally oracle-efficient. We characterize the sample complexities of both local and global convergence, accounting for both finite-sample estimation error and the roles of exploration (online) and data coverage (offline). Occupancy-based PG naturally handles arbitrary offline data distributions, and, with one-line algorithmic changes, can be adapted to optimize any differentiable objective functional.}\n}"}},{"title":"On the Convergence of Stochastic Iterative Dynamic Programming Algorithms","uri":"jaakkolaConvergenceStochasticIterative","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"/jaakkolaConvergenceStochasticIterative/","metas":{"bibtex":"@article{jaakkolaConvergenceStochasticIterative,\n title = {On the {{Convergence}} of {{Stochastic Iterative Dynamic Programming Algorithms}}},\n author = {Jaakkola, Tommi and Jordan, Michael I and Singh, Satinder P},\n file = {/home/kellen/Zotero/storage/95ZWX95X/Jaakkola et al. - On the Convergence of Stochastic Iterative Dynamic Programming Algorithms.pdf},\n langid = {english},\n abstract = {Recent developments in the area of reinforcement learning have yielded a number of new algorithms for the prediction and control of Markovian environments.
